James Wright is the author of jwacs; he did the lexer, the Lispworks
parser and most of the source transformations, as well as all of the
static analysis and example code.

Greg Smolyn has contributed a great deal of code.  He added support
for cl-yacc and did most of the other work for getting jwacs to
compile under SBCL.  He also made some extensive grammar changes to
make the grammar unambiguous, and added support for loops (by writing
the loop-transformation and adding loop methods to the
cps-transformation).  He also wrote the ugly-printer and
uniquification transformation, and the initial error-reporting support
in the lexer.

Brian Patt contributed bug reports that helped track down a serious
omission in the cps transformation.

Pascal Bourguignon contributed a patch to get jwacs compiling under
Allegro Common Lisp.

Danny Stillebroer contributed several bug reports, and did the bulk of
the debugging for most of them.
