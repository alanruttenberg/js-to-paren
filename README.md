js-to-paren
===========

Convert javascript to parenscript. 

There were a number of places where parts of this code were none of
which quite worked for me in ABCL. In the end I took the version from
the Suave project's old darcs repository from the folder
"experimental/js-on-cl/" which had a version of js-in-parenscript.lisp
that seemed to be a (little) further along than any other version I
found.

So I and am building from there.
